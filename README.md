# Task Management Dashboard

A modern task management dashboard built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This application allows users to manage tasks in a Kanban-style board with drag-and-drop functionality.

## Features

- Kanban-style board with three columns (To Do, In Progress, Done)
- Create new tasks with title, description, and status
- Drag and drop tasks between columns
- Responsive design
- Mock API integration for data persistence

## Technologies Used

- React 18
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- @dnd-kit for drag and drop functionality
- @headlessui/react for accessible UI components

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd task-management-dashboard
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

```

## Architecture and Approach

The application follows a component-based architecture with TypeScript for type safety. Key architectural decisions include:

1. **Component Structure**: Components are organized by feature and responsibility, making the codebase modular and maintainable.
2. **State Management**: React's built-in useState and useEffect hooks are used for state management, as the application's complexity doesn't warrant a more complex solution.
3. **Mock API**: A mock API service is implemented to simulate backend interactions, making it easy to replace with a real API in the future.
4. **Drag and Drop**: @dnd-kit is used for drag and drop functionality, providing a smooth and accessible user experience.

## Self-Evaluation

### Summary
The implementation provides a solid foundation for a task management system with modern features like drag and drop and a responsive design. The code is well-organized and follows React best practices.

### Self-Criticism
1. The mock API implementation could be more robust with error handling and loading states.
2. The UI could benefit from more sophisticated animations and transitions.
3. Form validation in the NewTaskModal could be more comprehensive.

### Potential Improvements
1. Add user authentication and multiple board support
2. Implement real-time updates using WebSocket
3. Add task filtering and search functionality
4. Enhance the UI with more interactive features
5. Add unit tests and end-to-end testing
6. Implement proper error boundaries and loading states
7. Add task categories and labels
